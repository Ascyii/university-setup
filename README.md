# Managing LaTeX lecture notes

This repository complements my [third blog post about my note taking
setup](https://castel.dev/post/lecture-notes-3).


## Setup Google Calendar integration

To get the calendar script (`countdown.py`) working, follow step 1 and 2 of the [Google
Calendar Python Quickstart](https://developers.google.com/calendar/quickstart/python), and
place `credentials.json` in the `scripts` directory.
Then open `config.py` and edit the `ROOT` as well as the `USERCALENDARID`
variables to your own needs.
